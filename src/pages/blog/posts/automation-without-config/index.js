            <p style="font-size:0.8em">TL;DR/Spoiler alert: I'm working on a tool at PayPal called paypal-scripts and a
            personal one called [\`kcd-scripts\`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts). You should try it too!</p>

            I work on a team at PayPal that tries to make other teams more productive. One of the biggest problems we
            face is tooling. <em>Every team has to set up and configure tooling for testing, client-side bundling,
            linting, etc. etc. etc.</em> What invariably happens with this is developers have just enough time to get it
            working and then have to move on to other priorities.
            So **the tooling is less than optimized.** üò± Webpack configs work, but could be improved. Linters fall out
            of date and bugs that a good linting rule could have prevented get shipped. And who has the time to even
            think about setting up a typing tool like Flow??

            At PayPal we have a project "generator" (it's really just a repo that you clone). An unfortunate truth of
            generators is that they only bootstraps the project. They leave you with all the config and the burden of
            keeping things up to date. And if the generator authors update the generator, what about updating all the
            users? üòë

            One thing that has been awesome for the productivity of the entire React community has been
            [\`create-react-app\`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you're unfamiliar,
            create-react-app bootstraps react applications that have a great webpack build and jest for testing that
            supports babel and eslint. And it does this by leaving you with a single tool dependency and no
            configuration. That tool is called "react-scripts." This tool is a CLI
            [with scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts)
            for (among others) build and test. It couldn't be simpler (and if you think it could, then feel free to
            [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues)).

            Inspired by this, **I decided to start working on \`paypal-scripts\`**. It's the same basic idea, with one
            major exception. According to
            [create-react-app's core ideas](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/44cfbccfda665d6bfb626ce5528697de6033ee8e/CONTRIBUTING.md#core-ideas):

            > The purpose of this tool is to provide the best experience for people getting started with React, and
            > this will always be our first priority.

            For PayPal however, the goal is to make developers more productive at shipping better products. This is why
            it comes with a great default configuration so most of the time you shouldn't need to configure anything.
            Big productivity boost. At the same time, we do need to cover more use cases if we're going to provide our
            engineers real value, **so while create-react-app doesn't allow for custom configuration, paypal-scripts does.**

            There is a project called [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) by
            [Tim Arney](https://twitter.com/timarney). It's awesome. However, I've taken a different approach to making
            paypal-scripts configurable. Rather than allowing you to have a config file that accepts config and lets you
            return your "rewired" config, paypal-scripts will assume that you want the built-in configuration unless
            you've configured things yourself. For example, if you add a \`.babelrc\` file or a \`babel\` property to
            your \`package.json\`, then paypal-scripts will use your babel configuration rather than the built-in
            config. This makes things much more predictable and less magical. ‚ú®

            To make things even better, paypal-scripts exposes all of its configuration so you can compose your custom
            config with the built-in config ‚ö°Ô∏è. So if you wanted to add a custom babel plugin it's as easy as adding
            this to your \`package.json\`:

            \`\`\`
            "babel": {
              "presets": ["paypal-scripts/babel"],
              "plugins": ["glamorous-displayname"]
            }
            \`\`\`

            I've been using [a generator](https://github.com/kentcdodds/generator-kcd-oss) for
            [my open source projects](https://github.com/kentcdodds) for over a year now. It's been a huge productivity
            boost. However I've been suffering from all the same things I've discussed in this blog post. So with the
            excitement of creating paypal-scripts, I've also been working on
            [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts) which does the same things except encodes the
            preferences I have for my own projects in the CLI. I've been slowly adding it to my projects and I couldn't
            be happier with the git diffs üòç. I mean... [check this out](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/906238861067657221):

            [![Screenshot of a git diff showing kcd-scripts replacing more than 20 dependencies and config](diff.png)](https://github.com/kentcdodds/rtl-css-js/pull/20/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2)

            That's a ton of config and dependencies I no longer need to maintain üôå. Multiply that by the 100 packages
            I've published on npm and that's some pretty serious productivity gains üöÄ.

            It's open source, so you can go look at it and use it even if you like! But it's pretty specific to me,
            not well documented, and&nbsp;subject to my whims, so I suggest that you fork it and make of it what you
            want. Seriously, I recommend to anyone who has more than a handful of projects they maintain to create and
            use a tool like this. I'm already feeling the wins.

            Good luck to you all! üëç
